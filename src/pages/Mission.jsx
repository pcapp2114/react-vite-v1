            The mission of the Energy Department is to ensure Americaâ€™s security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions.
          </p>
          <p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Legacy Management (LM) has completed its High Performing Organization (HPO) Plan for FY 2021 to FY 2025. The HPO is an internal planning document LM staff use to set management excellence and program performance goals the organization will strive to meet over the next five years. A link to the plan is provided below. The new HPO plan summarizes LM's performance alongside its HPO goals and milestones between FY 2017 and FY 2020, as well as goals and milestones that LM will pursue for the next five years. LM exceeded the majority of its goals set in the previous plan, including maintaining a worker safety record better than the DOE average.</p>
          <p>Fuel cells produce electricity from a number of domestic fuels, including hydrogen and renewables, and can provide power for virtually any application -- from cars and buses to commercial buildings. The Fuel Cell Technologies Office (FCTO) focuses on applied research, development, and innovation to advance hydrogen and fuel cells for transportation and diverse applications enabling energy security, resiliency, and a strong domestic economy in emerging technologies.</p>
